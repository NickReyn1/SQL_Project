# SQL Project

This project initiall involved designing and creating a database and filling that database with some initial data. After which I wrote various queries to select data from the database based on specific objectives. I also used queries to make modifications to the data stored in the database. The purpose of this project is to provide a rough display of my knowledge of SQL.

## Set up

`cd` into the `sql-files` folder.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
